# Intuitive Machine Learning
----------
This is list for links to various resources that helps to gain intuition on machine learning. This does not help to make you master of machine learning but to get you started. 
For starters, machine learning may become overwhelming as this is very complex subject and involves complex maths. This list provide a way so that you can know what algorithm does, how it does, keeping you away from all the deep complexities involved.

More resources are to be added. Feel free to contribute to the list by sending a pull request.
